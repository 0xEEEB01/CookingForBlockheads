> Describe exactly what kind of compatibility the mod should provide. Be as thorough as possible, as I most likely have never played with the mod you're proposing and know nothing about it.**

> Also note that most compatibility can be achieved through data packs: https://blay09.net/mods/cookingforblockheads/compatibility.html

> If you create a data pack, please share it with us so it can be added to the next release and everyone can benefit from it.
